# DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT FINDERS

Flight Finders is a console-based (or GUI-based, depending on your version) application developed as part of my internship project. The program is designed to simulate a basic flight booking system where users can search for available flights, filter based on preferences, and book tickets with ease.

# ðŸ”§ Features:
âœ… Search flights by source, destination, and travel date

âœ… View a list of available flights with flight number, airline, departure & arrival time, and fare

âœ… Book selected flights and generate ticket details

âœ… Basic data validation and user input handling

âœ… Stored flight data using arrays / lists / files (based on your implementation)

âœ… Option to cancel bookings or view booked ticket history (if implemented)


# ðŸ’» Tech Stack:
Language: Java / Python / C++ (Edit as per your project)

Platform: Console Application / GUI (Swing, Tkinter, etc.)

Tools: VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ (if applicable)
